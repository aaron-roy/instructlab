![0_Image_0.Png](0_Image_0.Png) Ai Workflows

The AI landscape has quickly evolved into a reality where many enterprises are racing to embed AI into how they operate. AI can transform businesses but a lack of guardrails can lead to lead to ethical, legal, and regulatory violations. Roadblocks to responsible AI include the inability to: Respond to the growing and changing AI regulations Noncompliance with regulations and industry standards can cost your organization both time in supporting audits and millions in fines. Currently there are the EU AI Act, a White House executive order on the safe, secure and trustworthy development and use of AI, and the Singapore AI Governance Framework. 

## Manage Risk And Reputation

The proactive detection of bias and drift is necessary in protecting customer privacy, loyalty, trust and security. Biased or unexplainable model results can result in brand damage and customer mistrust, internal audits and fines. Visibility into model facts is important when defending analytic decisions to management, stockholders and outside auditors.

## Operationalize Ai With Confidence

Manual data science tools and processes can inadvertently introduce human errors into AI algorithms and models. Lengthy model lifecycles and manual approvals/model validation can lead to drift, and making incorrect assumptions can result in bias around age, sex, race, gender, etc. Responsible AI requires governance, the process of directing,
