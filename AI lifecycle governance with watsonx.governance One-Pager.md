Drive ethical and compliant practices with a platform for generative AI models Implementing trusted, transparent AI requires governancethe directing, managing and monitoring of models across the AI lifecycle. Generative AI (gen AI) models are driving new risks, complexities and challenges, and the need to capture additional metrics. Manual processes and retrofitted tools can delay model deployment, hinder scalability and result in unfair, inaccurate results. Black-box models lacking transparency or metadata capture make it hard for data scientists and model validators to monitor and explain model outcomes. And manual communication and collaboration tools can extend model building and deployment cycles, resulting in lower-quality, inaccurate models. Whether using gen AI or machine learning (ML) models, you need lifecycle governance, which the IBM® watsonx.governance™ toolkit for AI governance provides through:
- **Automation** across the model lifecycle using AI-optimized

tools that drive scalability and increase efficiency
- **Transparent model processes** that drive performance visibility and help detect bias, drift and new gen AI metrics
- **Increased collaboration and communications** when automated processes shorten approval processes and help ensure stakeholder visibility Watsonx.governance offers a single governance platform for gen AI models and ML models built on third-party tools or platforms. Deployed on the cloud or on premises, the solution allows you to: - Monitor metrics and status for ML and generative models, including use cases, in-process change requests, challenges, issues and assigned tasks 
- Monitor details for model health including data size, latency, throughput, and text drift for gen AI
- Access validation tools for gen AI models and attribute how the output maps to context and reference data for Q&A use cases
- Track the progress of AI from development to test to production using model inventory
- Use automated collaboration tools, dashboards and customizable reports Watsonx.governance helps streamline and speed model processes, better detect and mitigate risk, and drive ethical and compliant practices. Explore the AI governance solution built to accelerate responsible, transparent and explainable AI.
