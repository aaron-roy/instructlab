Manage AI to meet upcoming safety, transparency regulations and policies worldwide Generative AI (gen AI) is driving new risks and complexities, with governments and industries focused on determining what level of governance is needed. Whether using gen AI or machine learning (ML) models, all need governance to direct, manage and monitor AI. This requires: 
Automation to identify and enforce upcoming regulations, replacing spreadsheets to alleviate error prone, timeconsuming tasks, and minimize misinterpretations and regulatory gaps when translating and recording. 

Transparent model processes are critical, especially for highrisk applications and when addressing requests from model validators, auditors and regulators. Transparency requirements are especially critical in highly regulated industries including finance, government and healthcare, and for global organizations facing multiple local laws and country-specific laws. 

Model documentation in a structured format brings consistency
