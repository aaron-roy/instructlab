# Ibm Watsonx.Data: An Open, Hybrid, Governed Data Store

Scale AI workloads, for all your data, anywhere Scaling AI requires trusted data, yet most organizations struggle with fundamental data challenges. According to IDC, by 2025 stored data will grow 250%1 with data rapidly propagating on premises and across clouds, applications and locations, likely with questionable quality. This situation can create more data silos, higher costs and added complexities with governing an organization's AI and data workloads. How do you combine the high performance and usability of a data warehouse with the flexibility and scalability of data lakes to address the challenges of today's complex data landscape and scale AI? Achieve this by optimizing your AI and analytics workloads and selecting the right engine for the right workload at the right cost-wherever your data resides. The new IBM® watsonx.data™ platform does just that because it's an open, hybrid 

![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png) and governed data lakehouse optimized for all data and AI workloads. This offering helps organizations drive the greatest value from their analytics ecosystem supported by 3 core benefits. 

Access all your data across hybrid cloud Access all your data through a single point of entry with a shared metadata layer across all clouds and on-prem environments. Get started in minutes

## Choose Fit-For-Purpose Query Engines

No single analytics engine can deliver on the breadth of demands that satisfy all analytics requirements. To fulfill such a wide variety of analytics requirements, multiple analytics engines are required. You can optimize costly warehouse workloads and help reduce data warehouse costs by up to 50% through workload optimization using cost-effective object storage and fit-for-purpose query engines.2 These include Presto, optimized for BI workloads, and Spark, optimized for machine learning and data science (ML/DS) workloads, that scale up or down automatically as your needs change. With just a few clicks, you can quickly add a new query engine of your choice to meet your price-performance requirements.

## Apply Built-In Data Governance, Security And Automation

Help protect data, manage compliance and maintain trust in data used for AI with built in-governance, access controls and enterprise security in watsonx.data. Integrate with IBM's centralized governance capabilities for automatic policy enforcement and enable responsible, transparent, and explainable data and AI workflows across the enterprise. Finally, you can discover, augment, refine and visualize watsonx.data data and metadata through the power of watsonx.ai models and conversational user experience.

## Share A Single Copy Of Data

Openness facilities collaboration. It can also improve data integrity and help address security risks by reducing the number of copies of data required to support different users and tools. And fewer copies mean less software, reduced hardware requirements and lower storage costs. With watsonx.data, you can access all of your data across both databases and data lakes. Share large volumes of data through open table formats, such as Apache Iceberg, built for high performance analytics and large-scale data processing. Support multiple vendor open formats for analytic data sets while allowing different engines to access and share the same data, at the same time using tools like Parquet, Avro, Apache Orc and more. Rely on watsonx.data to share metadata between multiple query engines using a single copy of data for all analytics and AI workloads.
